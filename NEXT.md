BONUS: Ensure there is a fully featured SwiftUI native app (that is not a kiosk)
that is a compainion to the portal and technican hub allowing users to open tickets and techs to assign and add comments (so they can work on the go). 

Allow for IT Asset tracking (with Asset Tag, Serial Brand and full meta data)
Extended this to ops as appropriate. 

(Future Plan)

Create a full service mailroom module for Ops, that allows package tracking, mail tracking, delivery (all for in-office use), duplicate scan etc. This should allow users to use their phone to scan the package, select the employee (if it cannot find it based on the label) track it (location, who it was recieved by etc with full audit log, reporting and lost package tracking.) and send notifications, email, slcak etc. 

Create the slackbot / webhook for IT / Ops and HR slack channels to receieve a notification when a new ticket is created / assigned (and send to the assigned user if possible). 

Allow for ticket archival and deletion. Allow for automatic clean up based on rules setup by admins. 

Allow for a roboust RBAC security role builder that allows admins to create and grant and inspect permissions to all aspects of the systems features. This way if an admin needs to allow a specific user access to a specific featute, they can do so and assign it via the UI or SSO as needed. 

Allow for Office Hours for departments and show a widget that displays this as approriate on kiosks and the apps. Allow admins and managers to create and manage this information and allow it to be dynamic but independent (if needed) nfrom kiosk status indicators.
