# Nova Platform Phases Breakdown

This document outlines the phased approach for implementing the Nova Universe based on the unified specification. Each phase is structured to:

* Deliver working functionality in logical sequences
* Emphasize reusing and improving existing code
* Ensure early value delivery
* Maintain security, scalability, and modularity throughout

---

## 🛰️ Phase 1: Foundation & Core Modules

**Objective:** Establish core infrastructure, admin control, and basic ticketing across platforms

### Modules

* Nova Core (Admin Dashboard)
* Nova Beacon (Kiosk Ticketing)
* Nova Helix (SSO/SCIM/Identity Engine)
* Nova Comms (Slack App)

### Key Tasks

* ✅ Integrate existing working code for Beacon form UI and SMTP fallback (only improve if new API method is more robust)
* ✅ Reuse working Slack modal and Supabase Edge Function; replace email logic with Core API submission
* ⬆️ Build full Helix SSO/SCIM system (Okta/Azure AD integration, NovaID mapping, role attribution)
* ⬆️ Construct secure Admin UI to:

  * View and edit tickets
  * Manage request catalog
  * Define roles and permissions

### Success Criteria

* Unified login via Helix
* Tickets can be submitted from Slack and Kiosk
* Admins can see/manage requests and catalog
* No duplicated code unless upgraded

## 🌌 Phase 2: User-Facing Portal + KB + Role Workflows

**Objective:** Launch Nova Orbit, integrate the Nova Lore KB, and define approval-based workflows

### Modules

* Nova Orbit (End User Portal)
* Nova Lore (Knowledge Base)
* Request Catalog Expansion
* Approvals Workflow (Core UI)

### Key Tasks

* 📦 Reuse existing frontend components from Orbit prototype if stable
* 🧠 Create KB backend + Markdown editor (public/private articles)
* 🛂 Build approval routing and approver UI in Nova Core
* 📋 Extend catalog metadata schema (approval\_required, SLA, etc.)

### Success Criteria

* End users can submit and track tickets via Orbit
* KB is searchable, usable in Cosmo, and restricted by role
* Approval dashboard functional
* Ticket workflows enforce metadata rules (SLA, approval, priority)

---

## 🚀 Phase 3: Pulse Agent Workflows + Escalation Engine

**Objective:** Enable full technician workflows, escalation paths, and ticket lifecycle management

### Modules

* Nova Pulse (Technician Portal)
* Escalation Engine
* Ticket Lifecycle Flow (Status → Resolution)

### Key Tasks

* 🧩 Build filtered queue views per role (`it`, `hr`, `ops`, `cyber`)
* 🔔 Implement escalation engine with inactivity, SLA breach, auto-assignment triggers
* 🔃 Allow techs to update ticket metadata, resolve, request approval, and add notes

### Success Criteria

* Techs can fully process and close tickets
* Escalations function automatically
* Audit logs are written for all changes

---

## 💫 Phase 4: Cosmo Assistant + Gamification

**Objective:** Deploy Cosmo as a conversational agent and implement unified XP system

### Modules

* Cosmo Assistant (Slack, Orbit, Pulse)
* Nova Ascend (Gamification Engine)

### Key Tasks

* 🔍 Train NLP engine to detect intent (from ticket history, KB, catalog)
* 🔗 Enable contextual ticket creation and KB suggestions
* 🧬 Log Cosmo interactions for analytics and confidence scoring
* 🏅 Deploy XP engine with agent leaderboards, title unlocks, and feedback-driven scoring

### Success Criteria

* Cosmo can help open tickets and suggest KBs
* Users earn XP for helpful actions
* XP drives visual progression (badges, titles)

---

## 🪐 Phase 5: Advanced Ops & Expansion

**Objective:** Bring in edge functionality and prepare for future scale

### Modules

* Nova Deck (Module Launcher)
* Nova Mailroom (Delivery Module)
* Analytics / Reporting Dashboards
* API Gateway + SDKs

### Key Tasks

* 🚪 Build Deck to launch into modules based on role
* 📦 Launch Mailroom queue + asset scan/ticket logic
* 📊 Build analytics view in Core (tickets, Cosmo, approvals)
* 🧱 Begin SDK authoring (JS, Swift, CLI, Webhook)

### Success Criteria

* All modules launchable via Deck
* Mailroom is operational and integrated with Ops
* Metrics view available for admins
* Developer-ready SDKs complete
