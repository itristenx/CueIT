# CueIT Admin

React based interface for viewing help desk tickets and managing system settings.

## Setup
1. Run `npm install` in this directory.
2. Create a `.env` file with `VITE_API_URL` and optional `VITE_LOGO_URL`.
3. Start the dev server with `npm run dev`.

The admin UI lets you search tickets, edit configuration values, activate kiosk devices and manage users from the new **Users** tab in Settings.
Font Awesome is loaded via CDN in `index.html` to provide icons throughout the interface.
