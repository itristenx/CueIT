## 🛡️ SECURITY FIXES IMPLEMENTED

### **Critical Vulnerabilities Resolved**
1. **Dependency Vulnerabilities** - Updated vite and related packages in admin UI
2. **Weak Default Secrets** - Replaced with secure generation requirements
3. **Environment Security** - Added validation and secure configuration templates
4. **Production Safeguards** - Prevented insecure production deployments

### **Security Hardening Applied**
1. **Authentication & Authorization** ✅ 
   - Strong JWT token implementation
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Secure session management
   
2. **Input Protection** ✅
   - Comprehensive input validation middleware
   - XSS prevention through sanitization
   - SQL injection protection with parameterized queries
   
3. **Network Security** ✅
   - Security headers (CSP, XSS protection, CSRF prevention)
   - Rate limiting on sensitive endpoints
   - HTTPS enforcement capabilities
   
4. **File Security** ✅
   - File type validation for uploads
   - Size limits and secure storage
   - Proper asset handling
