# CueIT Activate

A minimal React page for activating kiosks. It now shares the Tailwind and
DaisyUI configuration used by the admin interface for a consistent look.

## Setup
1. Run `npm install` in this folder.
2. Create a `.env` with `VITE_API_URL` pointing to the backend.
3. Start the dev server with `npm run dev`.
