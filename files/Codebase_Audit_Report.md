# Codebase Audit Report

## Executive Summary

This audit covers modernization, security, code quality, documentation, user experience, API design, and audit trail capabilities for the nova-universe codebase. All findings are actionable and prioritized for enterprise-readiness.

---

## Phase 1: High-Priority Modernization & Security

### 1. NPM Package Audit & Upgrade
- **Scope:** All `package.json` files in main apps and packages
- **Findings:**
  - Outdated dependencies, some with known vulnerabilities
  - Deprecated packages (manual review required)
  - Inconsistent use of lock files
  - No automated dependency update tools (Dependabot/Renovate/Snyk)
- **Recommendations:**
  - Upgrade all dependencies to latest stable versions
  - Replace deprecated packages with supported alternatives
  - Commit and maintain lock files
  - Integrate Snyk, Dependabot, or Renovate for automated audits and upgrades
  - Document breaking changes and upgrade decisions

### 2. Security Vulnerabilities & Compliance
- **Findings:**
  - No DKIM/SPF/DMARC for email authentication
  - Secrets/config sometimes loaded from DB, fallback to config service (improve secret management)
  - No rate limiting or abuse prevention for email endpoints
  - Error handling is present but lacks error codes and structured logs
  - No explicit input validation/sanitization for email addresses and content
- **Recommendations:**
  - Implement DKIM/SPF/DMARC for outbound email
  - Use secure secret management (env vars, vaults, never hardcode)
  - Add rate limiting to email endpoints
  - Use structured logging (JSON) and error codes
  - Validate and sanitize all user input

---

## Phase 2: Code Quality, Documentation, and API Design

### 1. Code Quality & Architecture
- **Findings:**
  - Good use of dependency injection (NestJS)
  - Explicit interfaces for types
  - Separation of concerns (config, DB, notifications, mail, Slack, spam detection)
  - Stubs for WebSocket/SSE, but not implemented
  - Lacks inline comments and JSDoc for public methods
- **Recommendations:**
  - Implement missing real-time notification features (WebSocket/SSE)
  - Add inline comments and JSDoc for all public methods
  - Refactor error handling for granularity and traceability

### 2. API & User Experience
- **Findings:**
  - API endpoints lack comprehensive documentation
  - No audit trail for user actions (email sent, failed, blocked, spam, etc.)
  - No rate limiting or abuse prevention
- **Recommendations:**
  - Document all API endpoints (OpenAPI/Swagger)
  - Implement audit trail for all user actions
  - Add rate limiting and abuse prevention

---

## Phase 3: Audit Trail Implementation

### 1. Audit Trail Assessment
- **Findings:**
  - No audit logging for email actions or user events
  - No tamper-resistant storage for logs
  - No RBAC for audit log access
- **Recommendations:**
  - Log all user actions (email sent, failed, blocked, spam, etc.)
  - Store logs in append-only, tamper-resistant DB table
  - Include metadata: user ID, timestamp, action type, affected records, IP
  - Use structured logging (JSON)
  - Integrate with monitoring/alerting
  - Provide RBAC-protected API for audit log queries

---

## Phase 4: Implementation Plan (Phased)

### Phase 1: Immediate Actions
- Upgrade all npm dependencies and commit lock files
- Integrate Snyk/Dependabot/Renovate for automated audits
- Implement input validation/sanitization for all endpoints
- Add DKIM/SPF/DMARC for email
- Secure secret management (env vars/vaults)

### Phase 2: Code Quality & Documentation
- Add JSDoc and inline comments
- Refactor error handling and logging
- Document all API endpoints (OpenAPI/Swagger)

### Phase 3: Feature Gaps & Audit Trail
- Implement real-time notification (WebSocket/SSE)
- Add rate limiting and abuse prevention
- Implement audit trail (logging, storage, RBAC, API)

---

## Concrete Code Patterns & Examples
- Use `class-validator` for DTO validation in NestJS
- Use `helmet` and CORS middleware for secure headers
- Use `winston` or `pino` for structured logging
- Example audit log schema:
  ```typescript
  interface AuditLog {
    id: string;
    userId: string;
    action: string;
    target: string;
    timestamp: Date;
    ip: string;
    metadata: Record<string, any>;
  }
  ```
- Example rate limiting middleware:
  ```typescript
  import { ThrottlerGuard } from '@nestjs/throttler';
  @UseGuards(ThrottlerGuard)
  ```

## Next Steps
- Assign owners for each phase
- Track progress in project management tool
- Review and iterate after each phase

---

## Next Steps for Unresolved Dependency Issues

The following apps/packages are currently unable to run due to unresolved dependency or vulnerability issues:

- **nova-synth**: 33 vulnerabilities detected (including critical/high severity). Manual triage and remediation required. Review `npm audit` output, prioritize critical issues, and update/replace vulnerable packages. Consider lock file cleanup and reinstallation.
- **nova-deck**: Fails to run due to unresolved dependency upgrades. Review all direct and transitive dependencies, update deprecated packages, and resolve breaking changes. Manual intervention required.
- **nova-orbit**: Fails to run due to dependency issues. Audit all dependencies, upgrade deprecated packages, and resolve any breaking changes. Manual remediation needed.
- **nova-core**: Fails to run due to dependency or upgrade issues. Review and update all dependencies, address deprecated packages, and fix any breaking changes.
- **nova-shared (packages)**: Fails to run due to dependency issues. Audit and update all dependencies, resolve deprecated packages, and address any breaking changes.

**General Remediation Steps:**
- Run `npm audit` and `npm outdated` in each affected app/package directory.
- Manually update or replace deprecated and vulnerable packages (see warnings above for recommended replacements).
- Clean up and regenerate lock files after upgrades.
- Test each app/package after remediation to confirm successful resolution.
- Escalate unresolved issues to project owners for further triage.
- Track progress and document all upgrade decisions and breaking changes in `DEPENDENCY_UPGRADE_LOG.md`.

Automated tools (Renovate/Dependabot) are now enabled for ongoing monitoring, but manual intervention is required for these critical issues.
