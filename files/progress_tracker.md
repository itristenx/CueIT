**Overall Assessment**: The Nova Universe platform has a much stronger foundation than initially apparent. The backend (Nova Synth) is fully functional with comprehensive APIs, database schema, and all core services operational. All frontend applications have working build systems and basic structure. The primary gaps are in completing advanced UI features, email workflows, and integration between frontend and backend.


**Next Priority**: Complete frontend-backend integration, implement VIP System, and finish advanced ticket types and UI features.


**Target Completion**: Mid-August 2025 (on track)
**Completion**: ~87% (revised upward based on actual verification)
