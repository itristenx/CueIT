üåå NOVA HELIX: Identity & Access Management Specification

This specification defines the identity architecture for Nova, integrating SSO, SCIM, and SAML for seamless enterprise-ready user management, including support for delegation, customer lookup, approval workflows, and full integration with the Nova Universe. This system is managed via Nova Helix and must be API-driven, secure, hardened, and resilient. It is written to be AI agent-executable.

‚∏ª

üîê Identity Provider Integration

Nova Helix must integrate with enterprise identity providers (IdPs) and support:
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ SSO (Single Sign-On) via SAML 2.0 / OIDC
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ SCIM 2.0 for automated provisioning/deprovisioning
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Group-based access control
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ User role mapping and dynamic permission grants

‚úÖ SSO Requirements
	‚Ä¢	Use Nova Helix as the centralized Identity and RBAC manager.
	‚Ä¢	Support IdPs like Okta, Azure Entra ID, Ping Identity, Google Workspace, etc.
	‚Ä¢	Map incoming SAML/OIDC claims to:
	‚Ä¢	email
	‚Ä¢	name
	‚Ä¢	title
	‚Ä¢	department
	‚Ä¢	groups
	‚Ä¢	userType

‚úÖ SCIM Requirements
	‚Ä¢	Support inbound SCIM for:
	‚Ä¢	Creating users
	‚Ä¢	Updating user attributes
	‚Ä¢	Deactivating users
	‚Ä¢	Managing group membership
  ‚Ä¢ Syncing extended profile information including:
    ‚Ä¢ `phone_number`
    ‚Ä¢ `organization_name`
    ‚Ä¢ `location`
    ‚Ä¢ `manager_id`
    ‚Ä¢ `cost_center`
    ‚Ä¢ `employee_number`

Deactivation Flow:
	‚Ä¢	When a user is removed via SCIM, they must:
	‚Ä¢	Be marked as deactivated in the system
	‚Ä¢	No longer be able to log in or be shown in lookup unless explicitly overridden
	‚Ä¢	Appear in the Admin > Deactivated Users panel for audit and potential deletion

Deletion Flow:
	‚Ä¢	Only deactivated users can be permanently deleted.
	‚Ä¢	Requires admin confirmation and audit trail.
	‚Ä¢	Users must be retained in logs for historical auditing.

‚∏ª

üßë‚Äçüíª User Types & Delegation

‚úÖ Delegation Assignment System

Delegation is implemented as a permission-based assignment, not a user type.

Features:
	‚Ä¢	Any user can delegate access to another user.
	‚Ä¢	Delegation grants include ability to:
	‚Ä¢	Submit tickets on behalf of another
	‚Ä¢	View ticket history of that user
	‚Ä¢	Approve on their behalf (if configured)
	‚Ä¢	Delegation is scoped, meaning:
	‚Ä¢	Only the designated user relationship is permitted
	‚Ä¢	Cannot be used to escalate privileges globally

Expiration & Control:
	‚Ä¢	Delegation can be temporary (with expiry date) or permanent
	‚Ä¢	Delegators and admins can revoke delegations at any time

Security & Audit:
	‚Ä¢	Delegates must be added by the user (auto-approved) or request delegate access in the request portal, running a workflow for approval to the selected user. 
	‚Ä¢	All delegation actions must:
	‚Ä¢	Be logged in the system audit trail
	‚Ä¢	Show both the acting user and the represented user
	‚Ä¢	Be queryable by admin and delegated users

UI Support:
	‚Ä¢	End users can:
	‚Ä¢	Grant/revoke delegation via My Account > Delegation
	‚Ä¢	Configure expiry and scope
	‚Ä¢	Admins can:
	‚Ä¢	View all delegation relationships
	‚Ä¢	Revoke or impose delegations
	‚Ä¢	Enforce rules via policy engine (e.g. max duration, allowed relationships)

Additional Protections:
	‚Ä¢	Delegation cannot be assigned to system-critical roles (e.g., admin ‚Üí admin)
	‚Ä¢	Delegation must go through optional approval if required by org policy
	‚Ä¢	Rate limiting and tamper detection should be enabled

Example: An Executive Assistant can be granted delegation to act on behalf of their manager until a set end-of-contract date.

‚∏ª

üîÑ Sync + Resilience Considerations
	‚Ä¢	All SCIM and SSO syncs should be logged and visible via the Admin > Identity > Sync Logs screen.
	‚Ä¢	Failed provisioning must trigger retry logic with alert notifications.
	‚Ä¢	SCIM/SSO activity should have its own log level and retention period.
	‚Ä¢	A monitoring dashboard should display:
	‚Ä¢	Last successful sync
	‚Ä¢	Most recent changes
	‚Ä¢	Error events

‚∏ª

üîç Customer Lookup Support (Kiosk + Portal)

Nova Helix must expose a lightweight customer directory API for internal lookup.

‚úÖ Customer Lookup Features
	‚Ä¢	Kiosk and web portal can:
	‚Ä¢	Search for users by name/email/title
	‚Ä¢	Autocomplete results via /api/lookup/customers?q=
	‚Ä¢	Admins can configure:
	‚Ä¢	Searchable fields
	‚Ä¢	Result display formatting (e.g., name + title + dept)
	‚Ä¢	Only active users are returned (deactivated users excluded unless override enabled)
	‚Ä¢	Delegates submitting tickets must be able to select only themselves or the delegated user by lookup
  ‚Ä¢ Customers should only be able to create tickets for themselves unless they have approved delegation.

‚úÖ : Enable cache fallback for kiosk offline mode.

‚∏ª

üßë‚Äçüíª Permissions & Group-Based Access Control

All permission logic should be centralized in Nova Helix, allowing:
	‚Ä¢	Group-to-role mapping via SSO/SCIM
	‚Ä¢	Dynamic permissions assignment
	‚Ä¢	Fine-grained permission control (e.g., manage forms, view tickets, admin dashboards)
	‚Ä¢	Permissions should cascade cleanly into Nova modules
	‚Ä¢	Support nested group resolution and OIDC custom claims

Ensure roles match what it them system, ensure they are documented and make any logical changes need to make roles robost and understandable. They should also be the ability to create custom roles with specific permissions. 
‚∏ª

‚úÖ Approval Workflow Engine (API-Driven)

The Nova Approval Engine must be implemented as a core part of the Nova API and designed for modular use across all request types.

üßë‚Äçüíº Approval Actors
	‚Ä¢	manager of the requester (based on AD attribute or directory)
	‚Ä¢	system owner (based on ticket system field config)
	‚Ä¢	custom approval group (manually assigned)
	‚Ä¢	delegate (if explicitly granted approval rights)

üõ†Ô∏è Approval Engine Features
	‚Ä¢	API-first design (/api/approvals)
	‚Ä¢	Multi-step approval chains (e.g., Manager ‚Üí IT Lead)
	‚Ä¢	Email and Slack notifications (configurable per org)
	‚Ä¢	Auto-escalation if no approval in X hours
	‚Ä¢	Approvals visible in:
	‚Ä¢	Admin UI
	‚Ä¢	Technician UI
	‚Ä¢	Requester Portal (status only / approval UI when manager approval required)
	‚Ä¢	Integration with ticket types and request forms
	‚Ä¢	Approvals must be auditable, filterable, and trigger webhooks

Approval States

Status	Description
pending_approval	Waiting for one or more approvers
approved	Fully approved
rejected	One or more approvers rejected
auto_approved	Approved via config timeout or rules
expired	No action taken, auto-expired

  # üìò Nova Helix SCIM Attribute Specification

This document defines all SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) attributes that Nova Helix should ingest and manage to support robust, enterprise-grade identity synchronization via SCIM 2.0. It is fully compatible with leading identity providers such as **Okta** and **Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)**.

SCIM attributes are grouped into three main schemas:

* **Core SCIM User Schema** (`urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:User`)
* **Enterprise User Extension** (`urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:enterprise:2.0:User`)
* **Nova Custom Extension** (`urn:scim:schemas:extension:nova:1.0:User`)

This schema layout ensures full interoperability with Okta and Azure AD SCIM connectors.

> `‚úÖ*` ‚Äì `novaId` is critical for identity continuity within Nova Helix. If SCIM linkage is broken, this value must be manually assigned or recovered by an admin.

---

## üîÑ Sync Best Practices

* SCIM schema must support **multi-schema payloads** per spec for Okta and Azure
* Ensure SCIM server declares supported schemas in `/ServiceProviderConfig`
* All SCIM attributes must be:

  * Validated on ingestion
  * Mapped to internal Nova Helix identity graph
  * Tracked in sync logs (including diffed changes)
* Optional attributes should be accepted but not required
* Unknown attributes should be ignored or stored as passive metadata (not cause failure)
* Provide SCIM `/Users`, `/Groups`, and `/Me` endpoints per spec
* Enable filtering, pagination, and sorting per SCIM spec (required by Okta)

---

## üîê Security Considerations

* Never trust incoming `roles` or `groups` directly ‚Äî always map to Nova roles via config
* Sanitize all `displayName`, `photos`, and text fields for injection risk
* `manager.value` must be validated as an existing user before assigning relationships
* Require bearer token for all SCIM requests with proper scope (e.g., `scim.write`, `scim.read`)
* Rate-limit and log all SCIM requests
* Provide override panel in Admin UI to **manually assign or recover NovaID** for users with lost/expired SCIM connections
