# Codebase Audit

## 1. Unfinished Code and Placeholders

### Identified TODOs, FIXMEs, and Placeholders

- **File**: `/apps/nova-orbit/src/app/request-catalog/page.tsx`
  - **Line 187**: Placeholder for "Search services..." in an input field.
- **File**: `/apps/nova-orbit/src/app/request-catalog/[id]/request/page.tsx`
  - **Lines 170-250**: Multiple placeholders for form fields (`field.placeholder`) in input, textarea, and select components.
- **File**: `/apps/nova-orbit/src/app/knowledge-base/page.tsx`
  - **Line 65**: Placeholder for "Search for articles, guides, or troubleshooting tips..." in an input field.
- **File**: `/apps/nova-orbit/src/app/tickets/new/page.tsx`
  - **Lines 90-103**: Placeholders for "Brief description of the issue" and "Detailed description of the issue, steps to reproduce, error messages, etc." in input and textarea fields.

### Unfinished Code

- **File**: `/apps/nova-orbit/src/app/request-catalog/[id]/request/page.tsx`
  - **Lines 20-50**: Interfaces for `RequestCatalogItem` and `FormField` are defined but lack implementation details for validation and default values.

## 2. Potential Vulnerabilities

- **Hardcoded Credentials**:
  - Found in `docker-compose.yml`:
    ```yaml
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD: nova_password
    ```
    This is a security risk and should be replaced with environment variables or a secrets management solution.

## 3. Ticket Creation and UI Features

- The ticket creation form in `/apps/nova-orbit/src/app/tickets/new/page.tsx` appears functional but relies on placeholders for user input guidance. These placeholders should be reviewed to ensure they are not temporary.

## Next Steps

1. **Resolve Temporary Placeholders**:
   - Replace placeholders with dynamic content or remove them if unnecessary.
   - Ensure all placeholders provide meaningful guidance to users.

2. **Complete Unfinished Code**:
   - Implement validation and default value logic for `RequestCatalogItem` and `FormField` interfaces.

3. **Address Vulnerabilities**:
   - Replace hardcoded credentials in `docker-compose.yml` with environment variables.

4. **Enhance Ticket Creation and UI**:
   - Review and finalize the ticket creation form to ensure it is ready for a demo.

This audit provides a roadmap for addressing current issues and ensuring the codebase is demo-ready.
