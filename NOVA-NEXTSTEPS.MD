# 🚀 NOVA API - SDK Readiness Requirements

This document defines the requirements and standards for making the **NOVA API** fully SDK-ready. The goal is to ensure the API is **secure**, **scalable**, **update-friendly**, **developer-friendly**, and **fully documented** for third-party SDKs across web, mobile, and desktop platforms.

---

## 🧠 Core Principles

- ✅ **Consistency:** RESTful design, consistent naming, standard responses.
- ✅ **Security First:** Auth, rate-limiting, logging, and audit trails.
- ✅ **Versioned:** Maintainable and future-proofed with semantic versioning (`v1`, `v2`, etc).
- ✅ **Modular:** Feature sets should be organized around modules (Orbit, Beacon, Pulse, etc).
- ✅ **SDK Friendly:** Clean and predictable interfaces with reliable responses and error handling.

---

## 🔐 Security Requirements

- OAuth 2.1 / OpenID Connect support
- Support for short-lived **access tokens** + refresh tokens
- **API key** support (scoped + revocable)
- **RBAC-aware endpoints** (respect roles from Nova ID / Nova Helix)
- **Rate limiting** per tenant, per user, and per key
- **Audit logging** for sensitive API usage
- **CORS** and **Content-Security-Policy** headers
- **IP allowlisting** (optional per tenant)

---

## ⚙️ Technical Standards

### API Design
- RESTful endpoints (`/v1/tickets`, `/v1/users`, etc)
- Consistent HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- JSON request/response bodies only
- Predictable, documented error codes (`400_BAD_REQUEST`, `401_UNAUTHORIZED`, etc)
- Pagination (`limit`, `offset` or `cursor` based)
- Filtering and sorting support

### Versioning
- URL-based versioning (`/v1/`)
- Deprecation notices in response headers
- Ability to run multiple versions concurrently

### Documentation (Developer Portal)
- Auto-generated API docs (Swagger / Redoc)
- Postman Collection
- Curl and code examples in:
  - JavaScript / TypeScript
  - Python
  - Swift
  - Kotlin
  - C# (.NET)
- **Try-it-out** console
- SDK links and installation instructions

---

## 📦 SDK Requirements

Each SDK must:
- Be **typed** (TypeScript, Swift, etc.)
- Support **auth workflows** (OAuth2 / token injection)
- Have **retry + backoff** logic for transient failures
- Handle **rate limit errors gracefully**
- Auto-generate from OpenAPI spec (if applicable)
- Support **uploading and downloading files** where applicable
- Be **modularized per feature** (e.g., `Tickets`, `Users`, `Chat`, etc)

### SDK Platforms
- ✅ JavaScript/TypeScript (Browser & Node.js)
- ✅ Swift (iOS)
- ✅ Kotlin (Android)
- ✅ Python (Scripting & Serverless)
- ✅ C# (.NET / Xamarin)
- 🧪 (Optional) Go / Rust / Ruby if dev demand justifies

---

## 📚 Documentation Structure

All API endpoints and SDKs should have:
- 🔍 Endpoint overview and purpose
- 📥 Request body schema (w/ examples)
- 📤 Response schema (w/ examples)
- ❌ Error cases and handling
- 🔐 Auth scopes needed
- 🧪 Test cases and sandbox environments

---

## 🌐 Developer Experience

- 🎓 Onboarding guides for devs
- 🔧 Sample apps and use cases (Slack Bot, Kiosk App, Admin Panel, etc)
- 📦 Package publishing (npm, pip, cocoapods, gradle, nuget)
- 🎯 CLI tool for debugging and testing APIs locally
- 💬 Developer support channel (e.g., Discord, Slack)

---

## 🔄 Update & Lifecycle Policies

- 🧠 API Change Log
- ✅ Semantic versioning: `v1.2.0` = minor, `v2.0.0` = breaking
- 📢 Webhook notifications for breaking changes (optional)
- 🔄 SDK version sync with API versions
- 📅 Deprecation timelines and sunset policies

---

## 📈 Monitoring & Analytics

- Request logging (structured logs)
- Error and latency metrics (per endpoint)
- SDK usage analytics
- Developer API dashboard (API key management, usage metrics)

---

## 🧪 Test & Sandbox Environment

- Dedicated `/sandbox` or tenant-level test mode
- Fake data generation for dev/test
- Token simulator for different roles (admin, tech, end_user, etc)
- Isolated rate limit from production

---

## 🔮 Future Considerations

- GraphQL overlay support (for Orbit or internal use)
- gRPC support (internal services)
- Multi-region edge API routing
- Edge function support (serverless compute at edge)
- AI-agent aware API instructions (Cosmo-compatible metadata)

---

# 🧾 Ticketing Logic & Request Form Configuration

This document outlines the logic, structure, and workflow for the ticketing system, including ticket types, statuses, resolution states, and request form handling.

---

## 🎫 Ticket Types & ID Structure

Each ticket type has a unique prefix and sequential identifier to maintain clarity and separation across the system:

| Ticket Type           | Prefix   | Example      | Notes                                                                 |
|------------------------|----------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Requests              | `REQ`    | REQ1245     | Once approved, creates a Task (`TASKXXXX`) assigned to a technician |
| Incidents (Help Desk) | `INC`    | INC12345    | Standard IT support tickets                                          |
| HR                    | `HR`     | HR12345     | Human Resources-related requests                                     |
| Operations            | `OP`     | OP12345     | Ops/Facilities service requests                                      |
| Tasks                 | `TASK`   | TASK1234    | Sub-tasks or follow-ups from REQ/INC/etc                             |
| Change Requests       | `CR`     | CR1234      | Structured changes or approvals needed                               |

Problem records should also exist and should start with PRB (PRB12345)

---

## 🚦 Ticket Statuses

Statuses are auto-managed via workflows, with options for manual override by authorized users.

### Primary Statuses

| Status                  | Description                                               |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `Open`                 | Ticket has been created and is awaiting action            |
| `Pending Customer`     | Awaiting input or response from the requester             |
| `Pending Support`      | Awaiting internal support team action                     |
| `Closed`               | Ticket fully closed; no further action required           |

- 🧠 **Automation Logic:**  
  - Ticket auto-transitions to `Pending Customer` if awaiting required input  
  - Returns to `Pending Support` upon customer reply  
  - Auto-closes if unresolved past SLA + no response for `X` days  

---

## ✅ Resolution Statuses

Resolution statuses provide more context upon ticket closure.

| Resolution Type       | Description                                             |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `Resolved (Permanent)` | Issue is permanently fixed and verified                 |
| `Quick Fix`           | Temporary solution applied; may require follow-up       |
| `Workaround`          | Non-ideal solution pending permanent fix                |
| `Cancelled`           | Ticket was cancelled before resolution                  |
| `Not Reproducible`    | Issue could not be reproduced or verified               |

---

## 🧰 Request Form Builder

The dynamic request form builder allows tailored form creation based on ticket type:

### Supported Categories:
- `IT` – Incidents, Service Requests
- `HR` – PTO Requests, Onboarding, Policy Questions
- `OPS` – Facilities, Equipment, Cleaning
- `TASK` – Manual task assignments
- `CHANGE REQUEST` – Formalized change control process

### Key Features:
- Select ticket type from dropdown (`IT`, `HR`, `OPS`, etc.)
- Conditional field visibility based on type
- Category determines auto-routing + ID format
- Auto-generates associated subtasks when needed (e.g., REQ → TASK)

---

## 🛠 Workflow Example

1. **User submits** a **REQ-1245** request for a new laptop  
2. Ticket is marked as **Open**, routed to IT  
3. Upon approval, a **TASK-2031** is created and assigned to a technician  
4. Once completed, **TASK** is marked **Resolved**  
5. Original **REQ** is updated with resolution details and **Closed**

---

## 🔒 Manual vs. Automated Control

- Admins and Technicians can manually override ticket status and resolution type.
- Automation handles 80% of lifecycle transitions:
  - New → Pending → Closed based on user/team input and SLA timers
  - Escalations or reassignment can be triggered by SLA breaches or role rules

---

## 📋 Future Considerations

- Add SLA timer displays in Admin + Tech views
- Enable audit history per status change
- Integrate escalation alerts for stale tickets

---

Ensure synth has automation builders fully functional and that automations can extend to other APIs etc as setup by admins. 

Workflows should also be "pre-built" for automations decribed in this document.

Everything MUST be completed. If its not, this project will fail. Ensure sucsses.
